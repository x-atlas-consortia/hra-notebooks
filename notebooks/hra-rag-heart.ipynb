       "In the \"cardiac atrium,\" several types of specialized cells are present. According to the context provided, these include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Cardiac Atrium Fibroblasts (CL_2000067):** These are fibroblast cells that reside specifically within the cardiac atrium. Fibroblasts play a crucial role in producing and maintaining the extracellular matrix and supporting tissue repair.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Endocardial Cells (CL_0002350):** These endothelial cells line the intracavitary lumen of the heart, including the chambers such as the atria. They are responsible for separating circulating blood from the underlying myocardium and releasing vasoactive substances like prostacyclin, nitrous oxide, and endothelin.\n",
